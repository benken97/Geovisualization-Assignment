                <gco:CharacterString>The ONS Neighbourhood Boundaries were created by the Ottawa Neighbourhood Study (ONS) to analyse population statistics and are not indicative of actual neighbourhood limits.  Neighbourhood refers to an inhabited area delineated by social and physical boundaries. ONS neighbourhood boundaries were derived based on census tracts, physical and demographic similarities, physical barriers (e.g. waterways, highways, etc.), maps used by the real estate profession (e.g. the Ottawa Multiple Listing Service), consultations with community stakeholders, as well as fieldwork by ONS researchers.

Accuracy: Boundaries are generalized (non-densified). Neighbourhoods are subject to a minimum population in order for data to be reliable at a neighbourhood level (i.e., not all individual communities can be separately represented within neighbourhoods).

Small communities cannot be described separately by the ONS because the population size is too small to create reliable estimates for many measures. Unfortunately, when small communities are included in larger neighbourhoods their unique character may be lost. This is a shortcoming of studies of this kind. Those who are using the ONS to help inform their planning decisions need to understand that the neighbourhoods described here may hide the unique strengths and challenges of some distinct communities or neighbourhoods within them. The ONS should be regarded as only one source of information; other sources that help identify these variations also need to be considered as part of any decision making process.

Update Frequency: As needed (official review every 5 years)
